# Solid Ether Course

This is the repository for the projects in the [Ethereum and Solidity Course by Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn).

It contains the following projects:

1. [scratch](./scratch)
   - This project contains a sample project that uses `solc` to compile a simple `Inbox` contract, test and deploy it.
   - To actual run the test, a local Ethereum instance should be running on port `8545` (preferably, via Anvil).
   - Details notes can be found in my [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/whitenoise1213/Smart-Contract-with-Solidity-bcbeea5a6cff480893df7a93f64a053b?pvs=4).
